# 🏥 Orthopedics-Analytics-Dashboard-2023

📖 The Story Behind the Dashboard

In a busy orthopedic clinic, patients were growing frustrated. Wait times stretched, satisfaction scores dipped, and staff were left guessing: Where’s the real problem?
This project is my answer to that question.

I built an interactive analytics dashboard in Excel, powered by DAX and pivot tables, to transform scattered data into sharp, actionable insights—bringing clarity to the chaos of care delivery.

📊 Project Overview

This dashboard helps orthopedic teams see the story their data is telling—from how long patients wait to how satisfied they leave.

With just a few clicks, the clinic can now:

📉 Spot where long waits are tanking satisfaction
🧠 Understand patient behavior across weekdays, months, and age groups
📈 Use real-time KPIs to guide staffing and scheduling decisions
🔍 What Makes It Unique

✅ Built for Action
DAX-Powered KPIs: Average PSAT Score, Wait Time, Total Patients
Real-Time Slicers: Filter by day of the week and month
Correlation Insights: Are more patients always the problem? Not always.
🎯 Designed for Humans
Visual clarity with customized chart styles
Data storytelling with real context (e.g., “Why are wait times always testing men’s patience like it’s a rite of passage?”)
Interactive and friendly—even for non-technical stakeholders
🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

Tool	Purpose
Excel	Interactive dashboards and KPI layout
DAX	Custom metrics and dynamic calculations
Power Pivot	Relational model for backend logic
Slicers	Real-time filtering by date and category
📈 Insights That Emerged

🧍‍♂️ Men aged 21–40 faced the longest wait times—yet were the most impatient
📆 Fridays had consistently lower PSAT scores, suggesting overloaded operations
🗓️ September, with moderate traffic, had one of the lowest satisfaction scores (3.5)
🤝 A small shift in staffing patterns could transform patient experience
💡 What I Learned

How to model dynamic metrics with DAX
Designing dashboards that balance form and function
Translating flat patient logs into operational insights
Telling a data story that makes users care, not just click
