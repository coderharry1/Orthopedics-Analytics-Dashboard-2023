## 📖 The Story Behind the Dashboard

In a fast-paced orthopedic clinic, wait times were rising, satisfaction scores were dropping, and the staff were left asking:  
**"Where exactly are we losing our patients—literally and figuratively?"**

So, I built this dashboard to answer that.

This Excel-based, DAX-powered analytics tool uncovers insights in seconds—turning raw patient logs into actionable strategies for hospital leadership.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard helps orthopedic teams **see the story their data is telling**—from patient satisfaction to operational bottlenecks.

Key metrics and filters allow teams to:
- Track **average wait times and PSAT scores**  
- Identify high-friction zones by **age group, weekday, or month**  
- Explore potential correlations between **volume and delays**
